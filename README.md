What impact does floating point precision have on Mandelbrot set calculations?

## The Problem In A Nutshell
How much is a Mandelbrot set image affected by the floating point precision of the code used to compute it?

1. The points in a region of a Mandelbrot set image have *sensitive dependence upon initial conditions.*  (This property is the "chaos" in "chaos theory.")  A small deviation in the value of C in Z=Z^2+C can lead to a very different outcome for one point versus another point that is only a miniscule distance from it.  This fact remains true at all scales of magnification, i.e., "miniscule" can be arbitrarily small. 
2. Floating point math cannot perfectly represent many rational numbers.  Moreover, floating point math can generate inaccuracies that can snowball with repeated calculations, including repeated operations of multiplication and addition.  Repeated multiplication and addition are the core of the Mandelbrot set algorithm.
3. Since the Mandelbrot set is always generated on a computer, typically using floating point math of some precision or other, we ask: How much of a Mandelbrot set image's visual complexity is due to the mathematical properties of the algorithm, and how much is due to floating point inaccuracies in its computer calculation?  Could some of the familiar visual properties of the Mandelbrot set simply be "noise" introduced by floating point calculations that have iterated thousands or even millions of times?

### The Problem at Large
This question has been posed [at least once on Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2731582/are-the-intriguing-and-lovely-mandelbrot-set-hoops-and-curls-the-result-of-float) but the original post was not understood, so no satisfactory answer resulted.

A 2013 academic paper, ["Images of Julia Sets That You Can Trust" ](https://mathr.co.uk/blog/2018-08-20_trustworthy_fractals.html), by L. H. de Figueiredo, D. Nehab, J. Stolfi, and J. B. Oliveira, raises similar questions for Julia sets, which are mathematical relatives of the Mandelbrot set.

### Background
If you are unfamiliar with the limitations of floating point arithmetic, read the classic essay ["What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic"](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) by David Goldberg for a good overview.  Basic introductions to the math involved in generating the Mandelbrot set are ubiquitous if you are unfamiliar with the algorithm.

### The Problem and Solution in More Detail
For a more detailed statement of the problem and the design of this program, [read the more detailed analysis here](./FloatCompMset.md).

## The Solution in a Nutshell
I wrote easy-to-modify c++ code that simply uses `typedef` to allow the user to explore the Mandelbrot set and to compare how the Mandelbrot set image looks when generated using the same parameters on the same points, but using three different floating-point implementations to calculate the result.  In addition to standard `float` and `double` types, the `Boost::Multiprecision` [cpp_bin_float](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/floats/cpp_bin_float.html) class was used to implement extended-precision floating-point types of the user's choice.

The program is multi-threaded so it generates the desired Mandelbrot set image in all three float types simultaneously.  Keys `<1>`, `<2>`, and `<3>` display the image as generated by the three different types of floating point precision that the user has selected.  Keys `<4>`, `<5>`, and `<6>` _subtract pairs of images_ to highlight any pixels that are different:

- `Key <4>` -- Subtracts image 1 from 2
- `Key <5>` -- Subtracts image 1 from 3
- `Key <6>` -- Subtracts image 2 from 3

Green pixels indicate a positive value following the subtraction, red pixels a negative value.
Basic statistics of the comparison are given in console output, such as the total number of pixels that are different, the percentage of the total image that is different, and the greatest difference between the values of the pixels (which tends to be close to the max iterations that one has selected for the Mandelbrot algorithm).  The console output also prints basic information about the three types one has chosen at start-up, such as digits of precision.

### An Example
Here are some sample images from a zoom in the neighborhood of C = -0.104943 + 0.927572i. Magnification is approximately 33E+6. The distance between adjacent pixels is 1/(2^33).  Max iterations is 30K.  Here's the image generated with standard `double` (53 bits of precision):


![Standard double](images/Set3-CppDouble.png)

Here is the same image generated with `cpp_bin_float_quad` (113 bits of precision).  Superficially it looks largely the same:


![Quad float](images/Set3-CppQuad.png)

But upon subtraction, we find that 8.77% ofthe pixels are different!  92,007 pixels out of 1,048,576 pixels total (or 59.5%) have different values.  These differences include points estimated to be in the Mandelbrot Set in one image and not in the other, as well as points which exceeded the orbit boundary check (i.e., the magnitude of Z > 2) in both images but at different iterations.  Here's what we get when we subtract the Quad image from the Double precision image:

![Difference](images/Set3-QuadMinusDouble.png)

Green pixels indicate where Quad > Double, and red pixels the opposite (i.e., where Double > Quad).

## Lines to Customize in the Code
The three floating point types are `typedef`ed as `first_float`, `second_float` and `third_float` throughout the code.  Variable names also have these names as suffixes.  Yes, templated code would be more elegant than coding everything in triplicate.  I began with templated code, but finding the proper arguments to pass to `std::asynch` for templated overloaded functions proved too hard.

### Set your types
Alter these three lines in the code to choose your own floating point implementations and _voila!_ You are all set to go.
```
typedef double first_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_quad second_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_oct third_float;
```

### Tweak your multi-threading preferences (optional)
Depending on how many cores you have you may wish to change `unsigned int numThreads;` This setting creates `numThreads` _for each of the three floating point types_.  So `unsigned int numThreads=4;` will start 12 threads initially.  Built-in types (like `float`, `double,` `long double`) go very quickly on most platforms because of intrinsic processor support.  So threads dedicated to those types will finish far more quickly than those using  `Boost::multiprecision`'s `cpp_bin_float` types.  Software-emulated floating-point support is always slower.  That's why they invented FPUs.

Each thread calculates a batch of pixels before rejoining the main thread.  You can tweak the amount per batch here:
```
unsigned int batchSize_first_float=10240;
unsigned int batchSize_second_float=2048;
unsigned int batchSize_third_float=512;
```
This can be useful, for example, for giving you a built-in type image quickly on screen 1 (batching 10K pixels at a time), while allowing different workloads for a 64-bit precision `cpp_bin_float` vs. 500-bit precision `cpp_bin_float` which will take much longer because of all the additional digits to multiply.

## Basic program controls
The mouse left-click is used to recenter the image; keys are used for everything else.  The GUI interface is functional but not as pretty or convenient as professional programs.  This tool is made for research.  Get Ultrafractal or Kalles Fraktaler to make beautiful images.

- **Period** - Zooms in by a factor of two
- **Comma** - Zooms out by a factor of two.  These are the only two zoom controls.
- **M, K, O** - Increase max iterations by 1, 10 or 100, respectively.
- **N, J, I** - Decrease max iterations by 1, 10 or 100, respectively.
- **P** - Pause calculation toggle.  This waits for existing threads to complete and then waits for unpause to spawn new ones, so its effect is not instant if you are working on some computationally intensive threads which must finish first.  Keep your batch sizes small for responsiveness.
- **U** - Unpause.  Doesn't toggle.
- **R** - Revert to prior coordinates for image center.  Works once.
- **C** - Toggle a small semi-transparent indicator of the center of the screen.  Useful for zooming.
- **/** (Forward slash) with mouse over a pixel - Gives coordinate info for that pixel in console
